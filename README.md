## In summary
I actually didn't mind the time I spent actually *using*  Stencyl, it was the a few other details that really eliminate it from consideration: it is clearly not a native Windows application. I don't just mean a few weird menus or that it was made with Qt (was it? Maybe). I mean the design itself looks like it was made a Mac OS around 1996, the two export options are either Flash (really?) and  HTML5, which requires the "Java Development environment (...*really?*). 

It also defaults it's project saves to a subfolder in **AppData**, buried in the user profile. It doesn't ask where you want to save it, it doesn't mention this is where to find it, I don't think there's even a preference to change this location within the program. It just plunks it right there in the AppData folder. 

But ignoring those three minor details...it wasn't horrible to work with.
